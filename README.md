Hello and welcome!

My name is Ivan Villa-Renteria and I am a CS coterm student at Stanford University.

I am focused on deep generative models for music and art and I also have additonal interests in both theoretical and interpretable deep learning. My aim is to use theoretical insights from deep learning and computer science at large to create more robust deep generative models for music and art applications and to effectively explain and interpret these models.

In my free time, I like to cook and play electric guitar.
