Hello and welcome!

My name is Ivan Villa-Renteria and I am a CS coterm student at Stanford University.

I am fascinated by deep generative models for music and art and I also have additonal interests in both theoretical and interpretable deep learning. I seek to use theoretical insights from deep learning and computer science in general to create more robust deep generative models for music and art applications and to effectively explain the behavior of these models.

In my free time, I like to cook and play electric guitar. I also like to produce music with DAWs such as Ableton and FL Studio.

You can reach me at ivillar {at} cs {dot} stanford {dot} edu.
