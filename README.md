Hello, my name is Ivan Villa-Renteria and I am a CS coterm student at Stanford University. I am primarily focused on multimodal deep learning for Music and Art, and I also have interests in theoretical deep learning and interpretable deep learning.

In my free time, I like to cook and play electric guitar.
